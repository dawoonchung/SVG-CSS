# SVG and CSS Animations Experiment
An experiment on CSS animation and transition using SVG script.
The logo used in the experiment is from Aalto University and **I do not have any privilege to use this experiment to any production**.

The experiment works the best only on Safari.
Chrome fails to relocate the position of element after finish of animation keyframes.
Firefox has problem of not calculating transform-origin properly as mentioned in [bug 1209061](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1209061).
Internet Explorer and Edge do not support CSS transform styling on SVG yet.
